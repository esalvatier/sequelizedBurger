#Eat-Da-Burger App
Allows user to enter burgers into database and displays their 'status,' on the main page (that is whether they've been eaten or not). Also allows users to 'devour' a burger, changing it's status in the database.

## How to?
At the bottom of the page is a text box for the name of the burger to add to the database. Burger will initially appear in the section fo the page marked for those burgers still meant to be eaten, a button next to the burger name; allowing the user to devour it if it has not been eaten, or telling the user that the burger has already been devoured (the button will be disabled in this case).
